create the folders
1. steps-> to store the steps(functions of your model as a separate file)
2. pipelines -> to run the steps python files
3. data -> to store the data used by model
4.saved_models -> to store models that you saved_models
5.src ->


create python files
1. run_pipeline -> to run the whole project
2. __init__.py ->


inside steps folder, create python files

1. Ingest_data.py -> to take care of data consumption
2. clean_data.py -> to take care of data cleaning
3. train_model.py -> to take care of training the model
4. evaluate_model.py -> to take care of model evaluation

inside the pipelines folder, create python files

1. train_pipeline.py -> it imports all the python files from steps folder and puts them in a pipeline for execution
-> after this step, you can import the contents of this file to the run_pipeline.py file and then run the python file in terminal.

-> once the pipelines finish executing, run "zenml login --local --blocking" on the terminal.

-> go to the url and view you pipeline


--------------------------this is basically the setup.... which one can build on-------------------------------------------------------

1. the real information on your specific project can be filled in python files in src folder which are then integrated to the files in steps folder
